# Medical report assistant
Problem: There is extremely high complexity in the huiman body. 
Parsing through parameters from each part and having a holistic view of the current condition often leads to certain information being overshadowed

This application intends to aid the medical health professional to identify the high severity issues and get an initial assesment on the progress

## Getting Started: To-Do List

Follow these steps to set up and run the Medical Report Assistant:

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    * Get a copy of the project code onto your local machine.
    * `git clone <repository_url>` or download the ZIP file.

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Change directory into the project folder (e.g., `cd Streamlit-Medical-Assistant`).

3.  **Set Up Python Environment (Recommended):**
    * It's best practice to use a virtual environment.
    * `python -m venv venv`
    * Activate the environment:
        * Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
        * macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Install all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5.  **Configure Google API Key:**
    * Create a directory named `environment` inside the main project folder (i.e., at the same level as `app.py` and `utils`).
    * Inside the `environment` directory, create a file named `.env`.
    * Open the `.env` file and add your Google API key like this:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    * Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google API key obtained from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

6.  **Check ChromaDB Directory:**
    * The application will attempt to create a directory named `chroma_db_store` in the project's root to store the patient database. Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory for this to be created automatically.

7.  **Run the Application:**
    * Make sure your virtual environment is activated and you are in the main project directory.
    * Run the Streamlit app using the command:
        * `streamlit run app.py`
    * The application should open in your web browser automatically.

8.  **Start Using:**
    * Upload PDF or TXT blood reports via the "Process New Report" tab.
    * Enter a unique Patient ID for each patient (new or existing).
    * Use the "Symptom Analysis" tab for RAG-based suggestions.
    * View past reports in the "View Patient History" tab.
